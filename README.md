# Animation-CSS


Animation-CSS is a creative HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that features glowing gradients, animated orbiting dots, and interactive text effects. The centerpiece is a pulsating circle with multiple satellites orbiting around it in different directions and speeds, giving a cosmic feel. The text in the center animates in with a smooth fade and glow, and users can interact by clicking to change colors or trigger background transitions. This project demonstrates modern CSS animations, keyframe transformations, and lightweight JavaScript interactivity â€” a perfect showcase of frontend creativity.
